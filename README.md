# Coderbyte_python_exercise
Here I will solve and add the examples present in coderbyte.

=> cb_ex1.py: 
Change every letter in the string to the letter following it in the alphabet, so a becomes b, z becomes a, etc. And convert the vowel into uppercase if present.  

=> cb_ex2.py:
Add up all the numbers from 1 to num. And return num.

=> cb_ex3.py:
Capitalize the first letter of each word. 

=> cb_ex4.py:
The str parameter being passed and determine if it is an acceptable sequence by either returning the string true or false. The str parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several letters between them (ie. ++d+===+c++==a) and for the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by a + symbol. 

=> cb_ex5.py:
Return the string true if num2 is greater than num1, otherwise return the string false. If the parameter values are equal to each other then return the string -1.

# Coderbyte_python_exercise
Here I will solve and add the examples present in coderbyte.

=> cb_ex1.py: 
Change every letter in the string to the letter following it in the alphabet, so a becomes b, z becomes a, etc. And convert the vowel into uppercase if present.  

=> cb_ex2.py:
Add up all the numbers from 1 to num. And return num.

=> cb_ex3.py:
Capitalize the first letter of each word. 

=> cb_ex4.py:
The str parameter being passed and determine if it is an acceptable sequence by either returning the string true or false. The str parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several letters between them (ie. ++d+===+c++==a) and for the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by a + symbol. 

=> cb_ex5.py:
Return the string true if num2 is greater than num1, otherwise return the string false. If the parameter values are equal to each other then return the string -1. 

=> cb_ex6.py:
Take the num parameter being passed and return the number of hours and minutes the parameter converts to (ie. if num = 63 then the output should be 1:3).

=> cb_ex7.py:
Arrange the letters in a word in Ascending order.

=> cb_ex9.py:
Arrange the digits in descending order and in ascending order (adding zeroes to fit it to a 4-digit number), and subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. Then repeat the previous step. Performing this routine will always cause us to reach a fixed number: 6174. Then performing the routine on 6174 will always give you 6174 (7641 - 1467 = 6174). The program should return the number of times this routine must be performed until 6174 is reached. 

=> cb_ex10.py:
determine how many dots exist in a pentagonal shape around a center dot on the Nth iteration. For example, on the first iteration there is only a single dot, on the second iteration there are 6 dots, on the third there are 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots.
